        <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that empowers systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as "training data," in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core idea behind ML is to enable computers to find hidden insights in data, recognizing patterns, and making data-driven predictions. It underpins many modern technologies, from recommendation engines to self-driving cars.
        </p>

        <h2>Fundamental Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>1. Supervised Learning</h3>
        <p>
            In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled training data, meaning each training example comes with a corresponding "correct answer" or target output. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing it to generalize and make predictions on new, unseen data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Predicting a categorical label (e.g., spam/not spam, disease/no disease).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Neural Networks.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., house prices, temperature).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge/Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Regression.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Unsupervised Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithms try to find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data themselves. There is no "correct answer" provided during training.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clustering:</strong> Grouping similar data points together into clusters (e.g., customer segmentation).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction:</strong> Reducing the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the important information (e.g., for visualization or to speed up other algorithms).
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, Autoencoders.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Association Rule Mining:</strong> Discovering interesting relationships between variables in large databases (e.g., "market basket analysis").
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Apriori.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)</h3>
        <p>
            Reinforcement learning involves an "agent" learning to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, getting feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward, Policy, Value Function.</li>
            <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Game playing (AlphaGo), robotics control, autonomous driving, resource management.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Q-Learning, SARSA, Policy Gradients (REINFORCE, Actor-Critic methods like A2C, A3C, DDPG, PPO).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Deep Learning: A Powerful Subset of ML</h2>
        <p>
            Deep Learning is a sub-field of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction. It has achieved state-of-the-art results in complex tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Neural Networks (NNs):</strong> Composed of layers of interconnected "neurons."</li>
            <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> Primarily used for image and video processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):</strong> Designed for sequential data (e.g., time series, natural language).</li>
            <li><strong>Transformers:</strong> A newer architecture that has revolutionized NLP and is increasingly used in other domains like computer vision, enabling highly parallelized learning on sequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</strong> Two neural networks (generator and discriminator) competing to generate realistic data.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Monitoring & Maintenance:</strong> Continuously tracking model performance and retraining as needed.</li>
