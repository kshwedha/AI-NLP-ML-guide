    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-section single-page application, toggled by a top navigation bar (System Design vs. Business Models). Within each section, a sticky left sidebar provides company-level navigation. The main content area displays detailed information for the selected company/product, organized with clear HLD/LLD sub-sections for system design and comprehensive explanations for business models. This structure facilitates focused exploration of either technical architecture or strategic business aspects, allowing users to deep dive into specific companies and their key products/models. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Content is primarily text-based, presented in responsive cards using Tailwind CSS. Interactive elements include tab switching for main sections and sidebar navigation for companies/products, implemented with JavaScript for dynamic content loading and active link highlighting. Source links are provided at the end of each relevant content block for further exploration. No charts or complex graphics are used; focus is on clear textual presentation and intuitive navigation. No SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
