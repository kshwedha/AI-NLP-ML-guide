    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-column dashboard layout. The left column is a sticky sidebar with a search bar and a collapsible, categorized list of all 50 concepts for quick navigation and filtering. The right column is the main scrollable content area displaying the details for each concept in a card format. This structure was chosen to provide both a comprehensive overview and rapid, targeted access to specific information, which is ideal for a developer reference guide. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The primary interaction is the search/filter and click-to-scroll navigation, handled by JavaScript. This allows users to instantly find and jump to a concept. The content is presented in clean, well-spaced cards using Tailwind CSS to enhance readability. The "Infographic Idea" section within each card is visually separated with a different background and an icon to distinguish it from the core concept explanation. No charts are needed; the focus is on textual information architecture. No SVG/Mermaid used. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
